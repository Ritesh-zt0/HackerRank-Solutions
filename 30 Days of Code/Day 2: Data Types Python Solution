Day 2: Data Types

Objective
In this challenge, you will work with arithmetic operators..

Task
Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip),
and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost. Round the result to the nearest integer.

Solution:

def solve(meal_cost, tip_percent, tax_percent):
    tip = meal_cost/100 * tip_percent
    tax = tax_percent/100 * meal_cost
    # meal_cost = input("enter the cost of the meal")
      
    
    total_cost = tip + meal_cost + tax
    
    print(round(total_cost))

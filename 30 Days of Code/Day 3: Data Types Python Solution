Day 3: Data Types

Objective
In this challenge, we learn about conditional statements. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video.

Task
Given an integer, , perform the following conditional actions:

If  is odd, print Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Not Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Weird
If  is even and greater than , print Not Weird
Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not  is weird.

Solution in Python:

if __name__ == '__main__':
    N = int(input().strip())
if (N%2!= 0 or N%2 == 0 and 6<=N<=20):
  print("Weird")
else:
    if (N%2 == 0 and 2<=N<=5 or N%2 == 0 and N>20):
        print("Not Weird")
